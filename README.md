# Memory Match

> - Maintained by: `Ben Imberman`

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create a memory match game in which users try to match company logos.

## Project Feature List

Below is a list of features that can be found on this memory match project:

* An interactive board with clickable cards and statistics tracking
* When an incorrect pair is selected the cards transition back to their hidden position after a brief delay
* When a pair of cards are matched they remain shown
* When the whole game board is matched, the user is asked if he/she would like to play again
* The game is mobile compatible and can be played on iPhone 6/7/8 and iPad.

## Project Takeaways

* I learned about the balance and interaction that exists between HTML, CSS, and JS.
* I learned to code in a feature driven manner
* I learned how to break down larger features into manageable tasks
* I learned how to translate these manageable tasks into logical steps
* I learned how to turn these logical steps into functioning code
